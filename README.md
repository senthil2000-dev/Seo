# Search Engine Optimisation
## Project 1:
### Requirements: PHP, MySql, Javascript
### Goal: The website contains a site, image, and news search currently. Add features for video search with the poster images as thumbnails and also implement a complete location search with the google maps API. Also, allow users to play the video on a customized video player of the website itself and download it.
* Fork and clone this repository to your local machine.
* Use composer to install the dependancies.
* To get started: In the addDomain.php, add a function to crawl through videos and create a separate php file for implementation of location search and work on it. Also find innovative ways of storing and downloading the videos.
## Project 2:
### Requirements: PHP, MySql, Javascript
### Goal: Implementation of sort feature and improvised ranking system in addition to fetching updated content
* Fork and clone this repository to your local machine.
* Use composer to install the dependancies.
* To get started: In the index.php file, write queries to execute a sort by feature (based on popularity, relevance,time, etc) for the search engine, try scheduling cron jobs to recrawl the registered domains at regular intervals to fetch updated content (like news channels) and try implementing better ML-Algorithms with more parameters. Display the time taken to fetch the results as well.
* Challenge: Try storing user history and implementing recommended-searches/search-also-for. Also try preventing reindexing all entries and henceforth, reduce the time taken for the pagerank algorithm
